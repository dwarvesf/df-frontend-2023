# Development Tooling

In the previous assignment, we took a leap from a traditional web interface to a modern React application. Now, we're going to level up the project by incorporating TypeScript for type safety and setting up ESLint rules to ensure clean and convention-following code.

## Requirements

- Convert the [Assignment 02's React Project](../assignment-2/) into TypeScript to leverage better type safety and developer experience.
- Follow the predefined convention configuration from [@dwarvesf/react-eslint-config](https://github.com/dwarvesf/react-toolkit/tree/master/packages/eslint-config) to promote error-free code.

### Deliverables

- Deliver a Typescript-based React project that is well-structured, free of linting errors, and consistently formatted.
- **Bonus**: Enhance developer experience and code quality by configuring ESLint to run automatically before each commit. This way, every commit will abide by established code conventions. You might find tools like [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) valuable for this task.

### What Are We Looking For?

- A comprehensive and organized TypeScript project, ensuring safer and more predictable code.
- Effectively follow ESLint rules, demonstrating an adherence to coding standards and conventions.

## Submission

- Begin your project based on the existing codebase in `/assignment-3` folder. Use the following commands to get started with PNPM:
  ```bash
  # Install packages with PNPM
  pnpm install
  # Run the app in development mode
  pnpm start
  # Build the app for production
  pnpm run build
  ```
- Ensure all the assignment code resides in the `/assignment-3` directory.
- The final submission deadline is **28/09/2023**.
- After completing and setting up the deployable demo, open a Github issue in your forked repository titled **Submission for assignment 3**. Include the demo link in the description.
