## Assignment Submission

To submit your assignments, please ensure you have enabled the **Issues** feature in your forked repository. If it's disabled by default, you can enable it by navigating to `Settings > General` on your fork. Scroll down to the `Features` sub-section and check the `Issues` box.

Once enabled, follow these steps for each submission:

1. **Code Submission**: Place your submitted code in the respective `/assignment-[number]` folder on your fork.
2. **Deployment**: Deploy your project on a cloud service to generate a public preview link.
3. **Issue Creation**: Open an issue in your forked repository with the title `Submission for assignment [number]`. Ensure you include the public preview link in the issue description. Refer to [this example issue](https://github.com/zlatanpham/df-frontend-2023/issues/1) for guidance.

## Evaluation Criteria

We evaluate assignments based on the following criteria:

- **Timeliness**: The assignment must be submitted by the deadline (based on the time of the last commit in the assignment folder).
- **Requirements Fulfillment**: The assignment must fulfill all mandatory requirements.

Our team will carefully assess your submissions. After evaluation, we'll share the results and offer feedback on the corresponding open issue.
